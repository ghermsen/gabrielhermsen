            <h1>Hi, I am Gabriel</h1>
            <p>An economist and Data Science / Analytics Student</p>
        </header>
        <p>After years of working experience in the field of business development in companies of different types and sizes, I decided to study economics to specialize in the field of business and finance. At the university, I had contact with subjects where we used data and mathematical models to obtain explanations, predictions and assistance in decision-making in the business environment, such as statistics and econometrics. These subjects were the reason why I started diving into the world of technology in 2018 and combined these two worlds to create my first personal machine learning projects to apply them in the financial market.</p>
        <p>Since then, I have been specializing to be a professional increasingly qualified in solving problems using data, and today I am taking an MBA in Data Science and Analytics at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP), the best Brazilian university. With my experience and qualification acquired along the last years, I am able to transform data into value for your business, team and projects!</p>
